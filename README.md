# Library Management System

Welcome to the Library Management System project! This application is designed to manage library operations, including book tracking, member management, and handling CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for library resources. Developed using C# and utilizing Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles, this system integrates with Microsoft SQL Server for data storage and management.

## Technology Stack

- **C#**: The application is developed using C#, leveraging Object-Oriented Programming concepts for robust and maintainable code.
- **Microsoft SQL Server**: The database system used for storing and managing library data.
- **OOP Concepts**: Utilizes principles such as encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism to ensure a well-structured and scalable application.

## Features

- **CRUD Operations**: Full functionality to Create, Read, Update, and Delete books, members, and transactions.
- **Book Management**: Manage book details, availability, and categorization.
- **Member Management**: Track library members and their borrowing history.
- **Transaction Handling**: Record and manage book checkouts and returns.
- **User Interface**: A user-friendly interface for efficient library management.
- **Data Persistence**: Persistent storage using Microsoft SQL Server, ensuring data is saved and retrievable.

## Installation and Setup

To run the Library Management System on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Amikzz/Library-Mananagement-System.git

2. **Open the Project**:
   
   Open the project in Visual Studio (or your preferred C# IDE).

3. **Configure the Database**:
   
    - Ensure that you have Microsoft SQL Server installed and running on your machine.
    - Create a new database and update the connection string in the app.config file (or settings.json if applicable) to point to your SQL Server instance.
    - Run the provided SQL scripts located in the Database folder to set up the necessary tables and schema.

4. **Build and Run the Application**:

    Build the solution in Visual Studio.
    Start the application by running the main executable or debugging from within Visual Studio.

## Usage
- Launch the application and use the user interface to manage library resources.
- Utilize the CRUD functionalities to add new books, - manage members, and handle transactions.
- Explore the search and filter options to efficiently manage and track library items and user activities.
